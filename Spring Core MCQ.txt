**Answer:** A) @Configuration

**Explanation:**
`@Configuration` marks a class as a source of bean definitions.

---

### **13. What is the purpose of @ComponentScan?**

A) Scan database
B) Scan packages for components
C) Scan XML
D) Scan properties

**Answer:** B) Scan packages for components

**Explanation:**
It scans specified packages for classes annotated with stereotype annotations.

---

### **14. Which lifecycle method runs after bean initialization?**

A) destroy()
B) init()
C) afterPropertiesSet()
D) finalize()

**Answer:** C) afterPropertiesSet()

**Explanation:**
`afterPropertiesSet()` is called after dependency injection.

---

### **15. Which interface defines bean lifecycle methods?**

A) BeanFactory
B) ApplicationContext
C) InitializingBean
D) DisposableBean

**Answer:** C) InitializingBean

**Explanation:**
`InitializingBean` provides `afterPropertiesSet()` method.

---

### **16. Prototype scope means?**

A) One instance per container
B) Multiple instances
C) One per request
D) One per session

**Answer:** B) Multiple instances

**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**
Spring automatically resolves and injects dependencies.

---

### **20. Which autowiring mode injects by type?**

A) byName

C) First loaded selected
D) Ignored

**Answer:** A) Error

**Explanation:**
Spring throws `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException` unless `@Qualifier` is used.
