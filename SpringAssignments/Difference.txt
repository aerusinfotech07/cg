### Difference Between `@Bean` and `@Component` in Spring

#### **1. `@Bean` (Method-Level Annotation)**
- Used inside a `@Configuration` class to manually define beans.
- The annotated method returns an instance of the bean.
- Gives more control over the bean's creation and initialization.
- Typically used for third-party classes or when more customization is needed.
- The bean is automatically registered in the Spring container.

**Example:**
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
```
Here, `myService()` explicitly defines a Spring bean.

#### **2. `@Component` (Class-Level Annotation)**
- Used to mark a class as a Spring-managed component.
- Requires component scanning (`@ComponentScan`) for automatic detection.
- Works well for application-level components like services, repositories, and controllers.
- A specialized form of `@Component` includes `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`.

**Example:**
```java
@Component
public class MyService {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Hello from MyService");
    }
}
```
Here, `MyService` is automatically detected and registered as a bean.

#### **Key Differences**
1. **Declaration Style:**  
   - `@Bean` is used on methods inside a `@Configuration` class.  
   - `@Component` is used directly on a class.

2. **Detection Method:**  
   - `@Bean` requires manual declaration.  
   - `@Component` is automatically detected through classpath scanning.

3. **Use Case:**  
   - `@Bean` is useful for configuring third-party libraries or when more control over bean instantiation is needed.  
   - `@Component` is ideal for application-level classes that you control.

4. **Customization & Dependencies:**  
   - `@Bean` allows configuring dependencies and lifecycle methods explicitly.  
   - `@Component` relies on dependency injection for initialization.

**When to Use What?**  
Use `@Component` for your own application's services, repositories, and controllers.  
Use `@Bean` when dealing with external libraries or when fine-tuned control over bean creation is necessary.
