### College Management System Using Microservices (Java Spring Boot)

#### 1. **Overview**

A **College Management System (CMS)** helps manage various aspects of a college's operations, including student enrollment, faculty management, course offerings, grades, exams, and administrative functions. Using **Microservices Architecture**, each of these modules can be developed and managed independently.

#### 2. **Key Functional Requirements**
- **Student Management**: Handles student enrollment, profiles, and academic records.
- **Faculty Management**: Manages faculty profiles, schedules, and course assignments.
- **Course Management**: Maintains course details, including course offerings and schedules.
- **Grade Management**: Records and manages students' grades and performance.
- **Exam Management**: Schedules and organizes exams.
- **API Gateway**: Provides a single entry point for routing requests to different services.
- **Service Discovery**: Discovers microservices dynamically for inter-service communication.
- **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management for all services.

#### 4. **Microservices Architecture**

##### **Microservices and Responsibilities**

1. **Student Service**: 
   - Handles operations such as student registration, profile updates, and managing course enrollments.
   
2. **Faculty Service**: 
   - Manages faculty profiles, schedules, and course assignments.

3. **Course Service**: 
   - Handles course creation, updates, and assigning students and faculty to courses.

4. **Grade Service**: 
   - Manages student grades and performance records.

5. **Exam Service**: 
   - Manages exam scheduling and retrieval of exam details.

##### **API Gateway**: 
The **API Gateway** acts as the single entry point for the system, routing external requests to the appropriate microservice and handling cross-cutting concerns such as security and authentication.

##### **Service Discovery (Eureka)**: 
Each microservice registers itself with **Eureka** and can be discovered by other services for dynamic communication.

##### **Config Server**: 
A centralized **Config Server** manages external configurations for the microservices, such as database URLs, environment settings, etc.

#### 5. **Sample Mock APIs**

##### **1. Student Service API**

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/students`
- **Description**: Register a new student.
- **Request Body**:
   ```json
   {
       "name": "John Doe",
       "age": 21,
       "address": "123 College St",
       "email": "john.doe@example.com",
       "courseIds": [101, 102]
   }
   ```
- **Response**:
   ```json
   {
       "studentId": 1,
       "message": "Student registered successfully"
   }
   ```

##### **2. Faculty Service API**

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/faculty/{facultyId}`
- **Description**: Get details of a faculty member.
- **Response**:
   ```json
   {
       "facultyId": 10,
       "name": "Dr. Jane Smith",
       "specialization": "Computer Science",
       "courses": [
           { "courseId": 101, "name": "Data Structures" },
           { "courseId": 102, "name": "Operating Systems" }
       ]
   }
   ```

##### **3. Course Service API**

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/courses`
- **Description**: Add a new course.
- **Request Body**:
   ```json
   {
       "name": "Introduction to AI",
       "facultyId": 10,
       "credits": 3,
       "semester": "Fall 2024"
   }
   ```
- **Response**:
   ```json
   {
       "courseId": 103,
       "message": "Course added successfully"
   }
   ```

#### 6. **Database Design**

Each microservice has its own database to ensure loose coupling and separation of concerns.

**Student Service Tables**:
- **Students** (`studentId`, `name`, `age`, `address`, `email`)
- **StudentCourses** (`studentId`, `courseId`)

**Faculty Service Tables**:
- **Faculty** (`facultyId`, `name`, `specialization`, `email`)
- **FacultyCourses** (`facultyId`, `courseId`)

**Course Service Tables**:
- **Courses** (`courseId`, `name`, `facultyId`, `credits`, `semester`)
- **CourseStudents** (`courseId`, `studentId`)

**Grade Service Tables**:
- **Grades** (`gradeId`, `studentId`, `courseId`, `grade`)

**Exam Service Tables**:
- **Exams** (`examId`, `courseId`, `date`, `time`, `duration`)

---

#### 7. **Technology Stack**

- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot for each microservice
- **Database**: MySQL for each service (separate databases)
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Service Discovery**: Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka
- **Configuration Management**: Spring Cloud Config
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token) for security
- **Messaging (Optional)**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for asynchronous communication between services

---

#### 8. **Service Interaction Workflow Example**

1. **Student Registration**: The Student Service registers a new student and adds their profile information to the database. The service also manages the enrollment of students in courses.
2. **Faculty Management**: Faculty members are added to the system by the Faculty Service. Faculty profiles include courses they are teaching.
3. **Course Assignment**: Courses are created in the Course Service. The service ensures that students and faculty are correctly assigned to their respective courses.
4. **Grade Management**: The Grade Service records student performance in specific courses and updates the grades as needed.
5. **Exam Scheduling**: Exams for courses are scheduled through the Exam Service, with details about the exam time, date, and duration stored.

---

#### 9. **Communication Between Services**

- **Synchronous Communication (REST)**: Services communicate with each other using HTTP requests routed through the API Gateway.
- **Asynchronous Communication (RabbitMQ or Kafka)**: Some interactions, such as grade updates or exam notifications, can be done asynchronously using message queues.

---

#### 10. **Deployment Strategy**

- **Docker Containers**: Each microservice is containerized using Docker, allowing for isolated, flexible deployments.
- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: Kubernetes is used to orchestrate and scale the microservices automatically based on load.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines are used to automate testing and deployment using Jenkins or GitLab CI.

### Conclusion

By splitting the **College Management System** into separate microservices, each service can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled. This modular approach ensures better fault isolation, scalability, and maintainability, all while leveraging Spring Boot and modern microservice
