Creating a comprehensive Java application for a computer shop that leverages Java 8 features is a great way to demonstrate various concepts such as streams, lambda expressions, and functional interfaces. Below, I'll outline 50 scenarios that can be integrated into such an application. These scenarios will encompass product management, customer interactions, and quotation generation.

### 1. Product Management
1. **Add New Product**: Add a new computer component (CPU, GPU, etc.) to inventory.
2. **Remove Product**: Remove a product from the inventory by ID.
3. **Update Product Details**: Update the details of an existing product.
4. **Search Product by Name**: Find a product by its name using streams.
5. **List All Products**: Display all products in inventory.
6. **Filter Products by Type**: Filter products by category (e.g., hardware, software).
7. **Sort Products by Price**: Sort products based on their price using streams.
8. **Find Top N Expensive Products**: Get the top N most expensive products.
9. **Check Product Availability**: Verify if a product is in stock.
10. **Track Product Sales**: Maintain a record of sales for each product.

### 2. Customer Management
11. **Add New Customer**: Register a new customer.
12. **Update Customer Information**: Edit existing customer details.
13. **List All Customers**: Display a list of all registered customers.
14. **Search Customer by Name**: Find a customer using their name.
15. **Check Customer Purchase History**: Retrieve a customer's past purchases.

### 3. Quotation Generation
16. **Generate Quotation for Single Product**: Create a quotation for a single product purchase.
17. **Generate Quotation for Multiple Products**: Create a quotation for multiple product purchases.
18. **Apply Discounts on Quotations**: Implement discounts based on customer loyalty.
19. **Include Taxes in Quotations**: Automatically calculate taxes for each quotation.
20. **Generate Quotation in PDF**: Create a PDF file of the quotation for customer download.

### 4. Purchase Scenarios
21. **Purchase Product**: Complete a transaction for a selected product.
22. **Bulk Purchase Discount**: Apply discounts for bulk purchases.
23. **Payment Processing**: Process different types of payments (credit card, cash).
24. **Track Inventory After Purchase**: Update inventory after a sale.
25. **Return/Exchange Product**: Manage product returns and exchanges.

### 5. Reporting
26. **Daily Sales Report**: Generate a report of sales for a given day.
27. **Monthly Sales Summary**: Create a summary report for monthly sales.
28. **Top Selling Products**: Identify the top-selling products over a period.
29. **Customer Purchase Trends**: Analyze customer purchasing patterns.
30. **Inventory Status Report**: Report on current inventory status.

### 6. User Interface Features
31. **Search Bar for Products**: Implement a search bar to quickly find products.
32. **Filter Options on Product Page**: Allow filtering by price range and type.
33. **Sort Options on Customer Page**: Enable sorting of customers by last purchase date.
34. **Responsive Quotation Form**: Create an interactive form for quotation generation.
35. **Dynamic Product Recommendation**: Suggest products based on customer purchase history.

### 7. Functional Programming Features
36. **Stream Processing for Sales Data**: Use streams to process sales data.
37. **Lambda Expressions for Filtering**: Use lambda expressions to filter product lists.
38. **Functional Interfaces for Operations**: Implement functional interfaces for various operations.
39. **Method References for Sorting**: Use method references to sort customer lists.
40. **Optional for Handling Missing Data**: Use `Optional` to handle potential missing customer details.

### 8. Notifications and Alerts
41. **Low Stock Alert**: Notify staff when a product's stock is low.
42. **Email Confirmation for Quotations**: Send email confirmations of generated quotations.
43. **Customer Birthday Discounts**: Alert customers on their birthdays for special discounts.

### 9. Integration with External Services
44. **Integrate Payment Gateway**: Allow online payments through a secure gateway.
45. **Connect to Supplier API**: Fetch product data from supplier APIs.
46. **Currency Converter for International Sales**: Integrate a currency converter for international customers.

### 10. Miscellaneous Features
47. **Customer Loyalty Program**: Track and apply loyalty rewards to customers.
48. **User Authentication and Role Management**: Manage user roles (admin, sales).
49. **Feedback System**: Collect and analyze customer feedback.
50. **Audit Trail of Transactions**: Maintain a log of all transactions for accountability.

### Implementation Tips
- **Data Structures**: Use collections like `List`, `Map`, and `Set` to manage products and customers.
- **Lambda Expressions**: Use them for filtering, mapping, and reducing operations.
- **Streams API**: Utilize streams for data manipulation and aggregation.
- **Optional Class**: Handle nullable values gracefully.
- **Design Patterns**: Consider using patterns like Factory for creating products or Strategy for pricing strategies.

These scenarios can serve as a framework for a robust Java application that takes advantage of Java 8's features, providing both functionality and a modern approach to programming.
